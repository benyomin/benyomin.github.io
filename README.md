         ## changelog
         v. 1.3.3 - displayed pdf is now publishedVersion.pdf compiled from publishedVersion.Rmd
                  - HEAD is in decPropv#.Rmd
         v. 1.3.7 - actually compiled once, adding local copy of savesym.sty, apt-get installs a very old version of tex-live, I'm using a newer from a .deb, but there is a problem with installing packages on the fly that are declared with \require{package} in a .tex file
         v. 1.3.9 - works, except for text below H3, which overflows the margins, possible I commented out the H3 definition. Will make section H2 without a subheading for workaround.
         v. 1.4   - script to download Carlito font and install to tex-live distribution
