* changelog
** 1.3.7 - actually compiled once, adding local copy of savesym.sty, apt-get installs a very old version of tex-live, I'm using a newer from a .deb, but there is a problem with installing packages on the fly that are declared with \require{package} in a .tex file
** 1.3.9 - works, except for text below H3, which overflows the margins, possible I commented out the H3 definition. Will make section H2 without a subheading for workaround.
** 1.4   - script to download Carlito font and install to tex-live distribution
** 1.4.1 - try to send log files back to github
** 1.4.2 - builds locally after removing ukdate dependency (this fixed no /begin document)
** 1.4.3 - file xpatch.sty
** 1.4.4 - builds on travis! after tlmgr install kpfonts
** 1.4.5 - gh-publisher fixes
** 1.4.6 - trash gh-publisher branch
** 1.4.7 - deploy unit tests
