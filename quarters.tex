\section{Were the protests}\label{were-the-protests}

an inflection point for home prices? In our meeting of Jan 1, 2017 we
spent some time discussing this point, I don't know how/if/where I can
incorporate this into the proposal, but I would like to share the
results with you. As discussed, I find that prices are still rising, but
rising more slowly post-protest. Visually, we graph home prices in all
regions, as well as the national average, with a vertical black line at
the June 2011 protests. There are five years before the protests and 5
and 1/2 years post-protest. We are checking if the slope of the lines is
indeed less-steep after the protests. We find that in the ``Center and
Jerusalem Periphery'' and ``Northern'' regions, prices actually
accelerated post-protest. In all other regions they still rose, but rose
at a slower rate than they had before the protests. Thus, the protests
did demarcate an inflection point for housing prices. We then present
these changes in tabular format.

Quarters 1-23, 2006q1 to 2011q2 are pre-protest. (5.5 years) Quarters
24-47, 2011q3 to 2016q2 are post-protest. (5 years)

pre- and post- protest environment.

Most regions, and the national average experienced a slow-down in
housing price growth after the summer 2011 protests. Yearly average
price appreciation is shown for homes of 1.5-2.5 rooms. The before
protests period is q1 2006 to q2 2011. The after protests period is q3
2011 to q2 2016.

The ``Northern Region'', and the ``Center and Jerusalem Periphery
Region'' went against this trend, price appreciation in these two
regions actually accelerated post-protest.
