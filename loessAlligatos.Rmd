loess smoothing

```{r}
x = seq(1,15)
y = c(4,5,6,5,5,6,7,8,7,7,6,6,7,8,9)
plot(x,y,type="l",ylim=c(3,10))
lo <- loess(y~x)
xl <- seq(min(x),max(x), (max(x) - min(x))/1000)
out = predict(lo,xl)
infl <-c(FALSE, diff(diff(out)>0)!=0)
lines(xl, out, col='red', lwd=2)
points(xl[infl],out[infl],col="blue")

```
try to find the inflection points
I think this means that 7 and 9 on the original graph are the inflection points, 7 is where y starts to go up less quickly. 9 is where y starts to decrease more quickly.
```{r}
y777<-c(NA,diff(out))
plot(xl,y777)
```
